## 10/5/2025 12 PM - Got Idea and created basic PCB  

I thought about some useful projects I could do and came up with this.
A charger for your phone and other devices and some usb-a ports would be quite useful on my desktio.
So I painted some prototypes in paint and then realized, that the hardest part is propably gonna be creating the PCB. I started with the PCB as you can see in the Image.![image-1759663517155.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIwLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--90777b8085c2428bf13af554ea70c43ae1211563/image-1759663517155.png)
  

## 10/5/2025 8 PM - Worked on schematic for pcb  

I worked on the PCB creation a Power Protection to the circuit so that if you would put too much power on the usb-c port the chips wont fry. I also added an ESD protection to protect the powerlines of the usb-a ports that you can use for your flash drives.

## 10/6/2025 - Symbol creation for pcb  

I again worked on the pcb and added the Power Switches for the usb-a ports and all that comes with that.
After that I worked on my own symbol, because it doesn't exist yet so I'm working on creating the 48pin chip only got one of the 4 sides done but in the future working on all others.
