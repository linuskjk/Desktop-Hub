## 10/5/2025 2 PM - Got Idea and created basic PCB  

I thought about some useful projects I could do and came up with this.
A charger for your phone and other devices and some usb-a ports would be quite useful on my desktio.
So I painted some prototypes in paint and then realized, that the hardest part is propably gonna be creating the PCB. I started with the PCB as you can see in the Image.![image-1759663517155.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIwLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--90777b8085c2428bf13af554ea70c43ae1211563/image-1759663517155.png)
  

## 10/5/2025 10 PM - Worked on schematic for pcb  

I worked on the PCB creation a Power Protection to the circuit so that if you would put too much power on the usb-c port the chips wont fry. I also added an ESD protection to protect the powerlines of the usb-a ports that you can use for your flash drives.

## 10/6/2025 - Symbol creation for pcb  

I again worked on the pcb and added the Power Switches for the usb-a ports and all that comes with that.
After that I worked on my own symbol, because it doesn't exist yet so I'm working on creating the 48pin chip only got one of the 4 sides done but in the future working on all others.

## 10/11/2025 12 AM - Finishing Schematic of PCB  

This was a quite challenging part.
Firstly I want to use multiple USB-Ports at simultaneously so we need a controller to control those ports. The problem is, that there were only Chinese datasheets for the chip I use so I had to manually translate the datasheet. After that I had to create the chip myself as a symbol in KiCAD which is quite time consuming. When I was done with that, I had to wire all those pins up and place a bunch of resistors and capacitors. Now I also added the USB-A ports and a USB-C port to the schematic so it is basically done. Next thing will be routing and defining the PCB and all...

## 10/11/2025 10 PM - Aligned the components and started routing the GND and VBUS  

It took me about 2.5 hours to align all the components correctly, while ensuring the capacitors and resistors were close enough to their connectors. Finally, the layout is perfect (USB-C for upstream on the back and 2xUSB-A & 1xUSB-C on the front for downstream).
I've also started routing the ground and VBUS pins.
Now I'm routing all the other pins and fixing, what comes with it.

## 10/15/2025 1 PM - Routed the PCB  

After some time, I've finished routing the circuit board. The main challenge was ensuring the correct track width for the charging ports so that they can be used for fast charging. Now I'm going to prepare the housing for the PCB and the MagSafe charger so that you can charge your devices wirelessly.

## 10/15/2025 5 PM - Created 3D model for the Case  

After completing the circuit board, I created the 3D model of the case in Fusion. I added holes for the connectors on the front panel. I also created some brackets for the circuit board. To make the whole thing more manageable, I implemented some cable holders. I designed it as minimalistic as possible.
